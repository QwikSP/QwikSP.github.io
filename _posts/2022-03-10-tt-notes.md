[3/15 Linked Lists Notes](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csa/wiki/Tri-3:-Tech-Talk-1:-Linked-Lists-Part-2)

Linked lists are datastructures

They have lists


que john object --> datatype john

head pointer: beginning of list (always slimy in this case)
tail pointer: end of list (southward after southward is added)

deque --> remove head pointer

kinda logical first come first serve
or...
First in First out (FIFO)


Stack- will use push and pop

deque and push to reverse order of stack

a que has a linked list --> que will have date (ie. object john, object calvin, etc)

previous node is node previous

next node is null untill it is added


link list needs to be resized periodically and it needs

arraylist is a cobination of a queue and an array list
